  <h1>Blood Pressure Analysis Project</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      This project investigates the relationship between blood pressure (BP, in mm Hg) and 
      several explanatory variables in 20 individuals with high blood pressure. The predictors 
      include age (years), weight (kg), body surface area (BSA, m²), duration of hypertension (years), 
      basal pulse (beats per minute), and stress index. The aim is to identify which variables 
      significantly influence blood pressure and to construct predictive models.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      A preliminary data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and visualizations 
      such as histograms and scatterplots. Relationships between blood pressure and each predictor 
      were examined to identify potential linear associations and outliers. A correlation matrix 
      highlighted variables strongly associated with blood pressure and possible multicollinearity issues.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Simple Linear Regression</h2>
    <p>
      For a simple linear regression, the predictor with the strongest correlation with blood pressure 
      was chosen. The assumed model is:
    </p>
    <pre><code>BP_i = β0 + β1 * X_i + ε_i</code></pre>
    <p>
      where X represents the selected predictor. The estimated model was visualized together with the data, 
      showing a clear linear trend.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Model Significance</h2>
    <p>
      The hypothesis tested was H0: β1 = 0 versus H1: β1 ≠ 0. The results indicated that the model 
      was statistically significant, confirming that the predictor had a meaningful effect on blood pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Multiple Regression Model</h2>
    <p>
      A multiple regression model including all predictors was then built:
    </p>
    <pre><code>BP_i = β0 + β1*Age_i + β2*Weight_i + β3*BSA_i + β4*Dur_i + β5*Pulse_i + β6*Stress_i + ε_i</code></pre>
    <p>
      Coefficients and p-values were evaluated to determine which predictors were statistically significant.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Model Reduction Using BIC</h2>
    <p>
      The BIC criterion was applied to simplify the model. Predictors with low explanatory power were 
      removed, resulting in a more parsimonious model while retaining statistical significance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Multicollinearity Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated to assess multicollinearity in the full model. 
      The predictor with the highest VIF was excluded, and the adjusted model was evaluated, confirming 
      that multicollinearity had been reduced and the model remained significant.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Model Comparison</h2>
    <p>
      The simple, BIC-reduced, full, and multicollinearity-adjusted models were compared regarding 
      explained variance, predictor significance, and the interpretability of the coefficients. 
      The model providing the best balance between fit and simplicity was selected for further analysis.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Model Validation</h2>
    <p>
      For the selected model, assumptions were checked: constant variance of residuals was assessed 
      using residual plots, normality was evaluated with Q-Q plots, and leverage and Cook’s distance 
      were used to identify potential outliers and influential points.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Prediction</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, the selected model was used to predict blood pressure for the individual with predictor 
      values equal to the first patient in the dataset. A 95% prediction interval was calculated to 
      quantify uncertainty around this estimate.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Method</h2>

  <h3>a) Preliminary Data Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    All analyses were performed using R. The initial exploration of the data included scatterplots 
    and density plots to visualize distributions, detect outliers, and identify unusual patterns. 
    Pairwise scatterplots were used to examine potential collinearity between explanatory variables.
  </p>

  <h3>b) Simple Linear Regression</h3>
  <p>
    Six simple linear regression models were created, each with blood pressure (BP) as the response variable 
    and one explanatory variable: Age, Weight, BSA, Duration of hypertension (Dur), Pulse, or Stress. 
    The assumed simple linear model is:
  </p>
  <div class="code-sample">
    Model 1: BP = β0 + β1*Age + ε <br>
    Model 2: BP = β0 + β2*Weight + ε <br>
    Model 3: BP = β0 + β3*BSA + ε <br>
    Model 4: BP = β0 + β4*Dur + ε <br>
    Model 5: BP = β0 + β5*Pulse + ε <br>
    Model 6: BP = β0 + β6*Stress + ε
  </div>
  <p>
    Here, β0 is the intercept, βi are the unknown parameters, and ε represents normally distributed errors 
    with zero mean and constant variance. The coefficient of determination (R²) was used to select the predictor 
    providing the best model fit.
  </p>

  <h3>c) Statistical Significance</h3>
  <p>
    To assess whether each model was statistically significant, t-tests were used. The null hypothesis 
    was H0: βi = 0. A significance level of α = 0.05 was applied; predictors with p-values below this threshold 
    were considered significant.
  </p>

  <h3>d) Multiple Linear Regression</h3>
  <p>
    A multiple linear regression model including all predictors (Age, Weight, BSA, Dur, Pulse, and Stress) 
    was fitted:
  </p>
  <div class="code-sample">
    BP = β0 + β1*Age + β2*Weight + β3*BSA + β4*Dur + β5*Pulse + β6*Stress + ε
  </div>
  <p>
    An F-test was used to evaluate the overall significance of the model, and individual predictor significance 
    was assessed using p-values.
  </p>

  <h3>e) Model Reduction with BIC</h3>
  <p>
    Stepwise selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was applied to identify the best subset of predictors. 
    Predictors producing the lowest BIC were retained in the final reduced model, and their statistical significance was evaluated.
  </p>

  <h3>f) Multicollinearity Assessment</h3>
  <p>
    Variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated to detect multicollinearity. Predictors with VIF > 5 were considered 
    highly collinear and removed from the model. The adjusted model was re-evaluated to ensure continued significance.
  </p>

  <h3>g) Model Comparison</h3>
  <p>
    The four models (simple, full, BIC-reduced, and multicollinearity-adjusted) were compared based on explained variation (R²), 
    significance of predictors, and interpretability of coefficients. ANOVA and F-tests were used to determine any significant 
    differences between models.
  </p>

  <h3>h) Model Validation</h3>
  <p>
    Diagnostic checks were performed on the selected model. Constant variance of residuals was assessed using residual plots, 
    normality of errors using Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test, and serial independence with the Durbin-Watson test. 
    Leverage points, outliers, and influential observations were identified using hat-values, studentized residuals, 
    and Cook's distance.
  </p>

  <h3>i) Prediction</h3>
  <p>
    Finally, the selected model was used to predict the blood pressure of the first patient in the dataset. 
    A 95% prediction interval was calculated using the <code>predict()</code> function in R to quantify uncertainty.
