  <h1>Blood Pressure Analysis Project</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      This project explores the relationship between blood pressure (BP, in mm Hg) and several explanatory variables in 20 individuals with high blood pressure. The predictors include age, weight, body surface area (BSA), duration of hypertension, basal pulse, and stress index. The main goal is to identify which factors significantly influence blood pressure and to construct predictive models that could be useful in further studies.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Exploration and Preliminary Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The initial analysis of the dataset was conducted in R, using scatterplots, density plots, and pairwise comparisons to visualize distributions, detect outliers, and identify potential collinearity between explanatory variables. This preliminary exploration helped to understand the structure of the data, identify unusual observations, and guide the selection of appropriate statistical models.

    <h2>Model Building and Regression Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      To begin, six simple linear regression models were created, each using blood pressure as the response variable and one predictor at a time: Age, Weight, BSA, Duration, Pulse, or Stress. The model with the strongest correlation with blood pressure was selected based on the coefficient of determination (R²) and visual inspection of residuals to ensure the assumptions of linearity and constant variance were met. Statistical significance of the predictor was tested using t-tests at a significance level of 0.05.
    </p>
    <p>
      After evaluating the simple models, a multiple linear regression model including all six predictors was fitted. Coefficients and p-values were examined to identify which variables had a significant impact on blood pressure. Stepwise selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was then applied to simplify the model, removing predictors with low explanatory power while retaining statistical significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To further address potential multicollinearity, variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated. Predictors with VIF above 5 were considered highly collinear and were removed, after which the adjusted model was re-evaluated. Comparison of all models, including simple, full, BIC-reduced, and multicollinearity-adjusted versions, was conducted using explained variation (R²), F-tests, and ANOVA to identify the model that provided the best balance between fit, interpretability, and statistical validity.
    </p>

    <h2>Model Validation and Prediction</h2>
    <p>
      The final selected model was subjected to rigorous validation checks. Residual plots were examined to confirm constant variance, Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test were used to assess normality of errors, and the Durbin-Watson test verified independence of residuals. Leverage points, outliers, and influential observations were identified using hat-values, studentized residuals, and Cook's distance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the model was used to predict the blood pressure of the first individual in the dataset, providing a 95% prediction interval to quantify uncertainty. This analysis demonstrates a clear, methodical approach to understanding how multiple physiological and lifestyle factors contribute to blood pressure, while emphasizing the importance of statistical rigor and careful model validation.
